<h2>What's on my mind</h2>
<h3>Should I start putting the dishes away?</h3>
<p>Hal's back home, kitchen immediately a mess. But he does put the dishes away in the morning. Over recent months I've made it a point to <em>not do this job</em>, because it is one of the few cleaning jobs he can be trusted to do. I think this is a strategy to preserve my sanity by mentally allocating us different chores about the house: he puts the dishes away and can be counted on to take bins out/bring them back in, and I do everything else. Jayne, of course, does nothing. </p>
<p>I worry that if I say something about the cleanliness of the gaff, Hal will reply that I never put the dishes away and that I always clumsily stack them when I do my washing. So I'm currently debating with myself whether I should start doing this job more regularly before I say something. It would give me better leverage, but I also know that by doing the job I've pretended to allocate to him, my irritation and annoyance with the state of the house will be too much to bare.</p>

<ul>
<li>Afternoon run around the standard Chorlton loop, 7.5 km at 4:37 min/km. Didn't really want to go but felt fine and fairly speedy once I'd got going. I think my mental game is my biggest barrier to progress now.  #running </li>
<li>A fairly unproductive, distracted day. Mostly just messing about on PC, but struggled to maintain focus. Lots of youtube/podcast on the side. </li>

<li>Split 2025 and 2026 logs. Program reads data from both years, but only updates 2026 log. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learnt about dataclasses, and implemented them in badminton spreadsheet for some of the classes. </li>
